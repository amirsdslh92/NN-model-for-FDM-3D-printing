# A Neural Netwrok model for prediction of the properties of FDM 3D printed parts based on the 3D printer settings and variables defined by users

In this project the main objective is to develop an accurate model for prediction of the properties of 3D printed parts based on the 3D printer settings and variables defined by users. So, in this problem we have some user defined variable and some 3D printer setting parameters is input features and some mechanical and morphological characteristics of the 3D printed parts is output features or responses.
Herein, we have 9 input features and 3 output feature is listed below. The green ones are input features related to user defined variables and the yellow ones are input features related to the 3D printer setting. The red ones are the responses.
